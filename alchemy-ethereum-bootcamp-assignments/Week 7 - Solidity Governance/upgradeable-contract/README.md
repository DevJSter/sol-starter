# Upgradable smart contracts

👋 Welcome to my GitHub repository for upgradable smart contracts!

🤖 Are you interested in deploying smart contracts with the flexibility to fix bugs and make iterative upgrades? Look no further!

📝 In this project, we will explore smart contract upgradeability by deploying an upgradeable vending machine smart contract. Through this experience, you will gain a first-hand understanding of the importance of flexibility in smart contract development.

💻 The code in this repository is designed to showcase the process of creating an upgradable smart contract, from defining the storage structure to implementing the upgrade mechanism.

🔍 Feel free to browse the code and documentation to learn more about how you can implement upgradeability in your own smart contract projects.

👨‍💻 Thank you for checking out my project, and happy coding!
