**_TODO: YT LINK_**
This repo supports the tutorial [Dad Jokes On Chain]()

## How To Use The Repo
The repo is broken into 2 main sections via folders
**smartcontract**: This folder contains a foundry project with the smart contract which will hold the dad jokes and any reward that has been given to them. 

**frontend**: This folder contains the next.js project which will act as the front end for interacting with the smart contract. 

### Running the frontend
Clone the repo and then run `npm install` within the next folder. Once that completes you can start the front end via `npm run dev`
